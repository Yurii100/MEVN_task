# This is my first tutorial project, in which I implemented a small "to-do list" program on the MEVN stack, which is actually a way to add comments. The server side, which is the main part, is implemented in Express and the visual part is implemented in Vue, so you can find the visual part at the link in the submodule or here: "https://github.com/Yurii100/public.git".
